# Express API

A simple project to demonstrate how creating an API with Hono (on Deno) works. Hono can also be hosted on a number of providers including Cloudflare workers and AWS Lambda@Edge.

## Getting Started

1. [Install deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation).
2. Start the dev server with: `deno run --allow-net main.ts`.
3. Hit the API to create a JWT with postman.
